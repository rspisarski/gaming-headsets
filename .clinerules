```

## Feature Requirements

### Core Features (MVP)
1. **Main Listing Page**
   - Display all headsets in a grid/list
   - Client-side filtering by:
     - Price range (slider)
     - Brand (checkboxes)
     - Wireless/Wired (toggle)
     - Platform compatibility (checkboxes)
     - Battery life (min threshold)
     - Weight (max threshold)
   - Sorting options: Price (low/high), Battery life, Weight, Name

2. **Individual Headset Pages**
   - Clean layout with specs displayed clearly
   - Multiple affiliate link buttons (Amazon, Best Buy, etc.)
   - Price comparison widget showing all retailer options
   - Related/similar headsets section

3. **Favorites System**
   - Save/unsave headsets to favorites
   - Store in `localStorage` (no backend needed)
   - "Export Favorites" button → downloads JSON file
   - "Import Favorites" button → uploads JSON file to restore
   - Visual indicator on favorited headsets

4. **Export/Import Functionality**
   ```javascript
   // Export format
   {
     "favorites": [12, 45, 89, 103],
     "exportDate": "2026-01-12T10:30:00Z",
     "version": "1.0"
   }
   ```

### Nice-to-Have Features (Future)
- Share favorites via URL (base64 encoded IDs in query params)
- Compare 2-3 headsets side-by-side
- "Best for..." filtered views (FPS gaming, streaming, music, budget)
- Dark mode toggle

## Design Principles

### Filtering & Display
- **Focus on objective specs only** - no subjective reviews or ratings
- Minimize listicles - use prose and paragraphs for content
- Clear, scannable spec tables
- Visual indicators for key features (icons)
- Mobile-responsive filtering (drawer/modal on mobile)

### Content Tone
- Professional but approachable
- Fact-based, not opinion-based
- No hyperbolic marketing language
- Acknowledge when specs matter vs when they don't

### Performance
- All filtering happens client-side (fast, no server round-trips)
- Lazy load headset images
- Optimize images through ImageKit URL parameters
- Target Lighthouse score: 95+ on all metrics

## Data Management

### Adding New Headsets
1. Create new markdown file in `/src/content/headsets/`
2. Use AI to extract specs from manufacturer page (with manual verification)
3. Upload product image to ImageKit
4. Verify all affiliate links work
5. Commit and push (Netlify auto-deploys)

### Data Quality Rules
- **Always verify AI-extracted data** against official sources
- Cross-reference battery life claims with user reports (often inflated)
- Note when "7.1 surround" is virtual vs actual discrete drivers
- Check compatibility nuances (e.g., wireless on PC but wired-only on Xbox)
- Update prices monthly (can be scripted later)

### Data Sources Priority
1. Official manufacturer specifications
2. Official retailer listings (Amazon, Best Buy)
3. User reports on Reddit/forums (for real-world data like battery)
4. Tech review sites (for measurements, not opinions)

## Monetization Strategy

### Affiliate Programs
- **Amazon Associates** - 1-4% commission (priority: volume)
- **Best Buy Affiliate Program** - 1-2%
- **Newegg** - 2-5%
- **Direct brand programs** - Check Razer, Corsair, SteelSeries, etc.

### Link Presentation
- Multiple retailer buttons on each product page
- Price comparison showing current prices across retailers
- Clearly labeled "Buy on [Retailer]" buttons
- Disclaimer: "As an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases"

### Realistic Expectations
- **First 3 months**: Expect $0-100 total
- **Months 3-6**: $50-300/month
- **Months 6-12**: $300-1,000/month (if done well)
- **Year 2+**: $2,000-5,000/month potential
- SEO takes 6-12 months to gain traction
- Don't quit the day job - this is a side project with long-term potential

## SEO Best Practices

### On-Page SEO
- Unique title and meta description for each headset page
- Use headset name + key features in H1
- Include specs in structured format (tables or definition lists)
- Alt text for all images: "[Brand] [Model] gaming headset"
- Internal linking between similar/competing headsets

### Content Strategy
- Focus on comparison keywords: "best wireless gaming headset under $100"
- Create category pages: "Best Headsets for PS5", "Best Budget Gaming Headsets"
- Write informational content: "Gaming Headset Buying Guide"
- Update content regularly (at least quarterly)

### Technical SEO
- Fast page loads (Astro is great for this)
- Mobile responsive design
- Clean URL structure: `/headsets/brand-model-name`
- XML sitemap (Astro generates automatically)
- Robots.txt properly configured

## Development Workflow

### Initial Setup (40-60 hours)
1. Set up Astro project with Tailwind (2-3 hours)
2. Design and build UI components (8-10 hours)
3. Create 20-30 initial headset markdown files (15-20 hours)
4. Build filtering/sorting functionality (8-12 hours)
5. Implement favorites with export/import (3-5 hours)
6. Set up ImageKit and optimize images (3-5 hours)
7. Test, polish, deploy to Netlify (3-5 hours)

### Ongoing Maintenance
- Add 5-10 new headsets monthly (2-4 hours)
- Update prices and availability (1 hour/month)
- Monitor affiliate links for breakage (30 min/month)
- Analyze traffic and optimize top pages (2 hours/month)
- Create new content (guides, comparisons) as time allows

## Code Style & Conventions

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use TypeScript where beneficial (Content Collections)
- Prefer functional components
- Keep client-side JS minimal
- Use descriptive variable names: `filteredHeadsets`, `priceRange`, `selectedBrands`

### Astro Specific
- Use `.astro` components for static content
- Keep interactive elements isolated to small components
- Leverage Content Collections for type safety
- Use Astro's built-in image optimization

### CSS/Tailwind
- Use Tailwind utilities primarily
- Extract common patterns into components, not custom CSS
- Keep responsive design mobile-first
- Avoid over-styling - clean and simple wins

### File Naming
- Kebab-case for files: `headset-card.astro`, `filter-bar.astro`
- PascalCase for components in imports: `<HeadsetCard />`
- Lowercase with hyphens for routes: `/headsets/steelseries-arctis-nova-7`

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-Launch Testing
- Test all filters with various combinations
- Verify favorites export/import works across browsers
- Check affiliate links redirect correctly
- Test on multiple devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Verify all images load and are optimized
- Check page speed (Lighthouse audit)

### Post-Launch Monitoring
- Monitor affiliate link click-through rates
- Track which filters are most used (analytics)
- Check for 404s regularly
- Monitor page load times
- Review search console for SEO issues

## Constraints & Limitations

### What NOT to Include
- User reviews or ratings (subjective, moderation nightmare)
- Comment sections (spam, moderation)
- User accounts (adds complexity, costs)
- Real-time price tracking (requires backend/scraping)
- "Best" rankings or scores (subjective, like Versus.com complaints)

### Design Constraints
- **No bullet points in prose** - write in paragraphs naturally
- **Avoid listicles** - don't structure content as "Top 10 Best..."
- **Minimal headers** - use sparingly, keep conversational
- No excessive bold/emphasis in content

### Technical Constraints
- Keep site fully static (no server needed)
- No database (all data in markdown files)
- Client-side filtering only (no API calls)
- Images must be external (ImageKit, not in repo)

## Success Metrics

### Traffic Goals
- Month 3: 500 monthly visitors
- Month 6: 2,000 monthly visitors
- Month 12: 10,000 monthly visitors
- Year 2: 50,000+ monthly visitors

### Revenue Goals (Realistic)
- Month 3: $0-50
- Month 6: $100-300
- Month 12: $500-1,000
- Year 2: $2,000-5,000/month

### Content Goals
- Launch: 30 headsets minimum
- Month 3: 50 headsets
- Month 6: 75 headsets
- Year 1: 100-150 headsets

## Key Differentiators

### vs Versus.com
- More focused niche (only gaming headsets)
- No subjective scoring system
- Cleaner, simpler UI
- Better data accuracy (manually verified)
- Feature-based filtering (not algorithm-based rankings)

### vs RTINGS.com
- Faster, simpler experience
- No paywalled content
- Focus on filtering by objective needs
- Less technical depth, more practical filtering

### Your Value Proposition
"Find the perfect gaming headset by filtering objective specs - not subjective reviews. Compare features that actually matter to you."

## Notes & Reminders

- This is a **side project** - work sustainably, don't burn out
- **SEO is slow** - expect 6-12 months before meaningful traffic
- **Quality over quantity** - 50 accurate headsets > 200 sloppy ones
- **Start small** - launch with MVP, iterate based on user behavior
- **Trust the process** - affiliate income compounds as content library grows
- **Skills matter for free tier** - using free services on Cloudinary means ALWAYS using ImageKit for better value
- When in doubt, **keep it simple** - complexity kills side projects

## Questions to Ask Before Building Features
1. Does this help users filter by objective specs?
2. Can this be done client-side without a backend?
3. Will this still work in 5 years without maintenance?
4. Does this add value or just complexity?
5. Would I use this feature myself?

If you answer "no" to any of these, reconsider the feature.
