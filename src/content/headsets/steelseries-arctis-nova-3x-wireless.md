## Overview

The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3X Wireless is the universal variant of the Nova 3 series, adding native Xbox Wireless support to make it compatible with every major gaming platform. Released in June 2025 at $109.99, it delivers premium wireless gaming audio at a budget-friendly price.

## Key Features

The Nova 3X's biggest advantage is true universal compatibility. Native Xbox Wireless support means seamless connection to Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One consoles, while also working flawlessly with PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile devices.

Access to the Arctis Companion App unlocks over 200 game-specific audio presets meticulously crafted by audio engineers, esports pros, and game developers. These presets can be changed on-the-fly in real-time without leaving your game, providing optimized audio profiles for Call of Duty, Fortnite, Apex Legends, and hundreds more titles.

The 40mm neodymium magnetic drivers deliver crystal-clear highs, pinpoint mids, and deep bass. Support for 360° Spatial Audio ensures immersive soundscapes, with full compatibility for Microsoft Spatial Sound on Xbox and Tempest 3D Audio on PlayStation.

Quick-Switch Wireless technology allows instant switching between high-speed 2.4GHz wireless gaming and Bluetooth 5.3 for mobile devices with a simple button press. Mobile connections remain on standby during gaming, so you can receive call notifications without interruption.

## Comfort

Weighing only 260 grams, the Nova 3X Wireless is designed for all-day comfort. The signature ski-goggle suspension headband distributes pressure evenly across your head, while breathable AirWeave memory foam ear cushions prevent heat buildup during extended gaming sessions. The tough, flexible dual-hinge design provides both durability and adjustability to fit various head sizes.

## Battery Life

Battery performance is outstanding with up to 40 hours of playtime on a single charge. Optimized fast charging delivers 9 hours of use after just 15 minutes of charging—up to three times more than typical gaming headsets.

## Microphone

The detachable ClearCast 2.X microphone features high-bandwidth 32KHz/16-bit audio technology, offering double the bandwidth and clarity of standard gaming mics. Bidirectional noise cancellation ensures your voice comes through loud and clear, even in noisy environments.

## Verdict

The Arctis Nova 3X Wireless is the ultimate budget-friendly option for gamers who need true universal compatibility. With native Xbox support, premium audio drivers, extensive EQ customization, and exceptional battery life, it's a compelling choice for multi-platform gamers.
