## Overview

The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3P Wireless represents an impressive entry point into premium wireless gaming audio. Released in June 2025, this headset brings many features from higher-end models down to an accessible $109.99 price point.

## Key Features

The standout feature is integration with the Arctis Companion App, which provides access to over 200 game-specific audio presets created by audio engineers, esports professionals, and game developers. These presets can be switched in real-time without leaving your game, providing tailored audio profiles for titles like Call of Duty, Fortnite, and Grand Theft Auto.

The 40mm neodymium magnetic drivers deliver rich, detailed audio with support for 360° Spatial Audio. Full compatibility with PlayStation 5's Tempest 3D Audio ensures immersive gaming experiences on Sony's platform.

Quick-Switch Wireless allows instant toggling between 2.4GHz wireless gaming and Bluetooth 5.3 connections with a simple button press. This dual connectivity lets you take calls or stream music while gaming.

## Comfort

At just 260 grams, the Nova 3P Wireless is remarkably lightweight. The ski-goggle style suspension headband distributes weight evenly, while breathable AirWeave memory foam ear cushions prevent heat buildup during marathon sessions. The dual-hinge design provides durability and a customizable fit.

## Battery Life

Battery performance is exceptional with up to 40 hours on a single charge. Fast charging provides 9 hours of playtime from just 15 minutes of charging—three times more than typical headsets.

## Microphone

The ClearCast 2.X detachable microphone features high-bandwidth 32KHz/16-bit audio capture—double the bandwidth of previous generation mics. Bidirectional noise cancellation ensures clear voice communication even in noisy environments.

## Verdict

The Arctis Nova 3P Wireless delivers premium features at a budget-friendly price, making it an excellent choice for PlayStation and multi-platform gamers who want quality wireless audio without breaking the bank.
