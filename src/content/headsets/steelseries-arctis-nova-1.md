## Overview

The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1 represents a compelling entry point into the acclaimed Arctis lineup, delivering the brand's signature comfort and audio quality at an accessible $59.99 price point. Released in October 2022, this wired headset strips away premium features like RGB lighting, wireless connectivity, and removable speaker plates to focus on what matters most: reliable performance and all-day comfort. At just 236 grams, it's one of the lightest gaming headsets available, featuring the same 40mm neodymium drivers found in SteelSeries' higher-end models along with the innovative ClearCast Gen 2 retractable microphone.

What sets the Arctis Nova 1 apart in the budget segment is its universal compatibility and thoughtful design. The 3.5mm connection works with virtually any gaming platform—PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and even mobile devices—making it an ideal choice for gamers who play across multiple systems. SteelSeries' ComfortMAX System with AirWeave memory foam cushions and the flexible ski-goggle suspension headband ensures comfortable extended sessions, while the retractable mic seamlessly disappears when not needed. Though it lacks the bells and whistles of more expensive headsets, the Nova 1 delivers where it counts for budget-conscious gamers seeking reliable audio and communication.

## Key Features

**Nova Acoustic System with Custom Drivers**: The Arctis Nova 1 features 40mm high-fidelity neodymium drivers—the same drivers used in SteelSeries' more expensive Nova 3 and Nova 7 models. These custom-tuned drivers deliver a frequency response of 20Hz to 22kHz with 36-ohm impedance and 93 dB sensitivity, providing balanced audio that excels in both gaming and music playback. The sound profile emphasizes clarity in the mids and highs, making dialogue and environmental cues easy to distinguish while maintaining adequate bass presence for explosions and music.

**ClearCast Gen 2 Noise-Canceling Microphone**: The fully retractable bidirectional microphone is a standout feature at this price point. Using AI-powered noise cancellation algorithms through SteelSeries Sonar software, it reduces background noise by up to 25dB, ensuring your teammates hear your voice clearly without keyboard clacks, mouse clicks, or ambient sounds. The retractable design allows the mic to completely disappear into the left earcup when not in use, creating a cleaner look for music listening or mobile use.

**ComfortMAX System with Ultra-Lightweight Design**: Weighing just 236 grams (8.3 ounces), the Arctis Nova 1 is remarkably light for an over-ear headset. The ski-goggle suspension headband automatically adjusts to your head size and distributes weight evenly across your skull, while the AirWeave memory foam ear cushions provide breathable comfort that prevents heat buildup during marathon gaming sessions. The rotating ear cups lay flat for easy storage and transport, and the headset is designed to be comfortable even for glasses wearers.

**Universal Multi-Platform Compatibility**: The simple 3.5mm analog connection ensures the Nova 1 works with any device that has a headphone jack. The package includes both a standard 4-foot (1.2m) 3.5mm cable for direct connection to controllers and mobile devices, plus a 5-foot (1.5m) dual 3.5mm extension cable with Y-splitter for PC use with separate headphone and microphone jacks. This versatility makes it perfect for PC gamers, console players, Steam Deck owners, and anyone who wants one headset for multiple systems.

**SteelSeries Sonar Audio Software**: While the headset works plug-and-play without software, PC users gain access to SteelSeries' powerful Sonar audio suite. The software provides 360° spatial audio for enhanced directional awareness, a professional-grade parametric 10-band EQ for fine-tuning your sound profile, and pre-made EQ presets optimized by esports professionals for popular competitive games. The software also powers the AI noise cancellation features of the microphone.

## Audio Quality

The Arctis Nova 1 delivers surprisingly robust audio performance for a budget wired headset, thanks to its 40mm high-fidelity drivers borrowed from higher-tier Arctis models. The frequency response leans slightly toward a balanced profile with a hint of emphasis on clarity over bass impact. In gaming scenarios, this tuning proves advantageous—footsteps, reloads, and environmental cues cut through the mix clearly without being harsh or fatiguing. The soundstage is respectably wide for a closed-back design, providing adequate spatial awareness for competitive gaming, though it won't match open-back or premium wireless models with dedicated spatial audio processing.

Music playback reveals the headset's strengths and limitations. The bass response is present but controlled, providing enough low-end presence for genres like electronic and hip-hop without overwhelming the mix. Reviewers noted the bass lacks the impact and depth found in bass-heavy gaming headsets, which may disappoint bassheads but appeals to those who prefer accuracy. The midrange handles vocals and instruments naturally, making the Nova 1 surprisingly pleasant for casual music listening. The treble has good detail and sparkle without becoming sibilant, though some users report minor distortion in lower mid-ranges at higher volumes and occasional difficulty separating complex layers in busy mixes.

When paired with SteelSeries Sonar software on PC, the audio experience improves considerably. The 10-band parametric EQ allows you to compensate for the lighter bass or adjust the sound signature to your preference. The 360° spatial audio feature enhances directional awareness in supported games, providing a competitive edge in titles like Counter-Strike, Valorant, or Call of Duty. Without the software (on console or mobile), the headset still performs admirably for its price point, delivering balanced, fatigue-free audio suitable for extended gaming sessions.

## Comfort & Build

Comfort is where the Arctis Nova 1 truly shines, carrying forward SteelSeries' legacy of creating headsets you can wear all day without discomfort. The signature ski-goggle suspension headband uses a stretchy elastic band that self-adjusts to your head size, eliminating the need for manual adjustment notches. This design distributes the headset's already-minimal 236-gram weight evenly across your skull, avoiding pressure points at the top of your head. Multiple reviewers emphasize that they frequently forgot they were wearing the headset during long gaming sessions—a testament to its lightweight construction and thoughtful ergonomics.

The AirWeave memory foam ear cushions are covered in a breathable mesh fabric that prevents the heat buildup common with leatherette pads. The ear cups provide approximately 49mm of width and 58mm of height internally, accommodating most ear sizes comfortably. The fabric is slightly stretchy, allowing the space to expand if needed. The ear cups rotate fully inward and can lay flat for storage, and the overall clamping force is moderate—secure enough to stay in place without causing discomfort, though some reviewers with smaller heads found it slightly tighter than expected. Glasses wearers consistently report comfortable extended use without the frame pressure issues common in many headsets.

The build quality reflects the budget-focused design, constructed primarily from plastic materials. While it doesn't feel premium like metal-framed competitors, the plastic is sturdy and well-constructed, avoiding the creaky, cheap feeling of bottom-tier headsets. The headband mechanism is reminiscent of older Arctis "ski goggle" designs, and some users caution that the elastic band may stretch out over time with heavy use. The left ear cup houses all controls: a simple volume wheel, microphone mute button, and the 3.5mm jack for the detachable cable. The included cables feel basic—functional but not braided or reinforced—with some reviewers wishing for higher-quality cables given the overall price point.

## Verdict

The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1 succeeds admirably as a budget-friendly gateway into quality gaming audio, making it an excellent choice for entry-level gamers, console players seeking reliable wired performance, and anyone wanting a lightweight multi-platform headset without breaking the bank. Its $59.99 price delivers genuine value through exceptional comfort, solid audio quality with the same drivers as pricier Arctis models, and one of the best microphones in the budget segment. The ultra-lightweight design and ski-goggle suspension make it comfortable for all-day wear, while universal 3.5mm compatibility ensures it works across PC, consoles, handhelds, and mobile devices.

However, the Nova 1's budget positioning means notable compromises. The 3.5mm-only connectivity limits functionality on devices lacking headphone jacks (many modern smartphones), and the analog connection means microphone quality varies depending on your source device—particularly noticeable on consoles where USB headsets often sound clearer. The sound profile, while balanced and pleasant, lacks the bass impact that bass-heavy gamers prefer and can struggle with complex audio layering. The plastic construction, while sturdy, feels less premium than metal-framed competitors, and the basic included cables fall short of expectations for a $60 headset.

For casual gamers on a budget, console players wanting plug-and-play simplicity, or anyone seeking a comfortable multi-platform headset for under $60, the Arctis Nova 1 is highly recommended. PC gamers who can utilize SteelSeries Sonar software will get even better value through customizable EQ and spatial audio. However, serious competitive gamers might want to invest in USB or wireless alternatives with more robust features, and audiophiles seeking premium sound quality should look at higher-tier options. Overall, the Nova 1 punches above its weight class in comfort and microphone quality while delivering dependable audio performance that makes it one of the best wired budget gaming headsets available.
