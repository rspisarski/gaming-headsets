## Overview

The Corsair Void Wireless V2 represents a reimagining of an iconic gaming headset, bringing modern features to a beloved design. This lightweight wireless headset combines versatile connectivity options with exceptional battery life and immersive spatial audio, making it an excellent choice for gamers who play across multiple platforms.

Weighing just 303 grams, the Void Wireless V2 features dual wireless connectivity via both ultra-fast 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth 5.3, allowing seamless switching between gaming on console or PC and taking calls on mobile devices. The headset's custom-tuned 50mm drivers deliver dynamic soundscapes enhanced by Dolby Atmos spatial audio support on compatible platforms.

## Key Features

**Dual Wireless Connectivity**: Switch effortlessly between low-latency 2.4GHz wireless for gaming and Bluetooth for mobile devices with the press of a button. The included USB-A dongle provides reliable wireless connection up to 50 feet for PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch.

**Exceptional Battery Life**: Game for days with up to 70 hours of battery life via 2.4GHz wireless, or extend it to an astounding 130 hours when using Bluetooth. Quick charging provides 6 additional hours of gameplay from just a 15-minute charge.

**Dolby Atmos Spatial Audio**: Experience dynamic 360-degree directional audio that allows you to pinpoint footsteps, explosions, and environmental cues with incredible accuracy. The headset creates an immersive soundstage that enhances competitive and cinematic gaming experiences.

**AI-Enhanced Microphone**: The omnidirectional boom microphone features NVIDIA Broadcast technology for users with compatible RTX graphics cards, utilizing AI to eliminate background noise and ensure crystal-clear team communication. The flip-to-mute design provides instant mic control.

**Customizable iCUE Software**: Take control of your audio profile with Corsair's iCUE software, offering custom EQ settings, pre-tuned audio profiles, customizable RGB lighting on the ear cups, and button remapping for the multifunction control.

## Audio Quality

The Void Wireless V2 features custom-tuned 50mm neodymium drivers that deliver a well-balanced sound signature with deep bass response and crisp highs. The frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz captures the full range of gaming audio, from subtle environmental details to explosive action sequences.

The headset's closed-back design provides good passive noise isolation, helping you focus on your game while keeping audio bleed to a minimum. With Dolby Atmos enabled on PC, the spatial audio creates a convincing surround sound experience that helps with directional awareness in competitive titles. The headset's V-shaped sound signature emphasizes bass and treble, making explosions and weapon fire impactful while maintaining clarity for footsteps and dialogue.

## Comfort & Build

Corsair designed the Void Wireless V2 for extended gaming sessions with comfort as a priority. The memory foam ear cushions wrapped in breathable microfiber fabric provide a soft, cool surface that prevents heat buildup during long play sessions. The lightweight 303-gram construction reduces fatigue, and the adjustable headband ensures a secure fit for various head sizes.

The predominantly plastic construction keeps weight down while maintaining adequate durability. The ear cups feature 90-degree swivel for better fit and storage, while the flexible frame accommodates glasses wearers comfortably. The mesh fabric covering on the cushions promotes airflow, though some users with smaller heads may find the fit slightly loose initially until the cushions conform to their shape.

## Verdict

The Corsair Void Wireless V2 hits a sweet spot in the mid-range wireless gaming headset market at $129.99. It successfully balances versatility, performance, and value by offering dual wireless connectivity, exceptional battery life, and solid audio quality across multiple gaming platforms. The addition of Dolby Atmos support and AI noise cancellation elevates the experience beyond its price point.

While it lacks some premium features like active noise cancellation or a detachable cable for wired use, the Void Wireless V2 excels at its core mission: providing reliable wireless gaming audio with minimal fuss. The impressive battery life means you'll rarely need to reach for the charging cable, and the seamless platform switching makes it ideal for gamers who own multiple consoles or frequently switch between gaming and mobile use. For players seeking a comfortable, feature-rich wireless headset that works across their entire gaming ecosystem without breaking the bank, the Void Wireless V2 is an excellent choice.
