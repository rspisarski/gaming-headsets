## Overview

The Logitech G522 LIGHTSPEED marks a significant evolution from the popular G733, bringing enhanced audio fidelity and an exceptional microphone to the mid-range wireless gaming headset market. As part of Logitech's G5 Series, it's designed for gamers who demand both performance and style.

## Key Features

The standout feature is the broadcast-quality microphone with 48kHz/16-bit sampling paired with BLUE VO!CE technology. This combination delivers studio-grade voice clarity with real-time filters and effects, making it ideal for streaming and competitive gaming communication.

Audio performance is driven by new synchronized PRO-G drivers made from biocellulose, delivering 48kHz/24-bit digital signal processing. This provides exceptional clarity for hearing subtle in-game cues like footsteps and weapon reloads. The headset supports DTS Headphone:X spatial audio on PC for enhanced positional awareness.

Tri-mode connectivity offers flexibility with LIGHTSPEED wireless (2.4GHz), Bluetooth 5.2, and USB-C wired connections. While you can't use LIGHTSPEED and Bluetooth simultaneously, switching between modes is quick and seamless.

The LIGHTSYNC RGB system features eight customizable zones per earcup with 16.8 million colors, synchronized with other Logitech G gear for a cohesive gaming setup.

## Comfort & Design

The G522 underwent a complete redesign focused on marathon gaming sessions. The lightweight 290g build features a reversible suspension headband that distributes weight evenly, with added ridges for breathability. Memory foam ear cups with soft-touch fabric provide excellent comfort, and the design is specifically tested to accommodate glasses and earrings.

The build uses 27% post-consumer recycled plastic, and the packaging is entirely plastic-free as part of Logitech's sustainability initiative.

## Battery Life

Battery performance is excellent, with up to 90 hours of playback with RGB lighting disabled, or 40 hours with it enabled. Many users report exceeding these estimates in real-world use. The battery charge is capped at 80% by default to extend long-term battery health.

## Software

Logitech G HUB provides extensive customization including custom EQ profiles, BLUE VO!CE microphone filters, RGB lighting control, and button remapping. The headset can store up to three onboard profiles for use without the software running.

## Verdict

The G522 LIGHTSPEED delivers impressive value at $159.99, offering near-flagship audio quality and the best microphone in its price range. While it lacks Xbox Wireless support and some may find the plastic build less premium than competitors, the exceptional comfort, stellar battery life, and versatile connectivity make it an excellent choice for PC and PlayStation gamers.
