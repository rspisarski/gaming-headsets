## Overview

The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7P Wireless Gen 2 is the second generation of the award-winning Nova 7 series, bringing significant upgrades while maintaining the $199.99 price point. Released in October 2025, this PlayStation-focused variant adds Arctis Companion App support and a massive 40% battery increase over the original.

## Key Features

The standout upgrade is the greatly improved battery life—up to 54 hours on a single charge (38 hours with simultaneous Bluetooth). Fast charging provides 6 hours of playtime from just 15 minutes of charging.

New Arctis Companion App support brings real-time audio control directly from your mobile device. Access over 200 game-specific audio presets crafted by audio engineers, esports pros, and game developers. Adjust EQ settings for popular titles like Call of Duty, Fortnite, and Grand Theft Auto without leaving your game.

Simultaneous 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connectivity is a major feature. Game on your PlayStation while staying connected to your phone for calls and music. The headset intelligently handles incoming calls by auto-muting game chat, then seamlessly switching back when you hang up.

The 40mm neodymium magnetic drivers deliver crystal-clear highs, pinpoint mids, and deep bass with support for 360° Spatial Audio. Full compatibility with PlayStation 5's Tempest 3D Audio ensures immersive gaming experiences.

## Comfort

At 326 grams, the Nova 7P Gen 2 remains lightweight for extended wear. The signature ComfortMAX system features height-adjustable rotating earcups, an elastic ski-goggle suspension headband that distributes pressure evenly, and breathable AirWeave memory foam cushions. The premium steel frame with PVD coating provides durability without excess weight.

## Audio Quality

The audio profile is tuned for gaming with emphasized clarity in mids and highs, making it easy to pinpoint directional sounds like footsteps. The headset supports up to 24-bit/48kHz audio when using the 2.4GHz wireless connection. SteelSeries' Sonar software provides professional-grade parametric EQ for deep customization on PC.

## Microphone

The fully retractable ClearCast Gen 2 bidirectional microphone features AI-powered noise cancellation, reducing background noise by up to 25dB. A bright red LED indicates when muted. While the mic delivers solid intelligibility for voice chat, the voice transmission has a slightly filtered quality common in gaming headsets.

## Verdict

The Arctis Nova 7P Gen 2 is an exceptional mid-range wireless gaming headset that excels at multi-platform versatility. With outstanding battery life, dual wireless connectivity, premium comfort, and extensive software customization, it's the perfect choice for PlayStation gamers who want no-compromise performance at $199.
