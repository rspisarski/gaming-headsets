## Overview

The 2023 refresh of the Razer BlackShark V2 Pro takes an already excellent esports headset and addresses its few weaknesses. The biggest upgrade is the "HyperClear Super Wideband" microphone, which offers voice quality that rivals standalone USB mics.

## Key Features

The microphone samples at a higher rate (32kHz) compared to standard headset mics (16kHz), capturing more detail and nuance in your voice. This is critical for clear communication in competitive games.

Battery life sees a massive jump to 70 hours, more than doubling the previous version. Quick charging gives you 6 hours of play from a 15-minute charge.

Audio profiles are tuned specifically for popular FPS titles like Apex Legends, CS:GO, and Valorant, providing a competitive edge out of the box.

## Comfort

At 320g and with memory foam cushions wrapped in breathable fabric, it's designed for marathon sessions. The clamping force is well-balanced to provide passive noise isolation without causing headaches.

## Verdict

For pure competitive gaming where communication is key, the BlackShark V2 Pro (2023) is currently the headset to beat.
