## Overview

The Razer Kraken V4 X, released in August 2024, brings the core Kraken V4 experience to budget-conscious gamers through a wired USB connection. At just $79.99, it delivers many of the features found in its wireless siblings—including TriForce 40mm drivers, retractable HyperClear Cardioid microphone, and vibrant Chroma RGB lighting—while eliminating the wireless components and battery to hit an aggressive price point. The included convertible USB-C to USB-A adapter ensures compatibility across PC, Mac, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, and mobile devices with USB-C ports.

The wired design offers distinct advantages beyond cost savings: zero latency, no battery concerns, and no wireless interference. For competitive gamers who prefer the reliability of wired connections or players building their first gaming setup on a budget, the Kraken V4 X provides impressive value. The hybrid fabric-leatherette memory foam cushions, improved swivel design, and lightweight 295g construction ensure comfort during extended gaming sessions, while the 7.1 surround sound activation (available through Razer's free software) enhances immersion without additional cost.

## Key Features

**TriForce 40mm Drivers** - Despite the budget price, the Kraken V4 X features Razer's patented TriForce driver design that separates high, mid, and low frequency tuning to prevent distortion and muddying. These drivers deliver clear, detailed audio with good soundstage for positional awareness in games. The frequency response covers the full standard range (20Hz-20kHz), ensuring you hear every detail from deep bass to crisp highs.

**Retractable HyperClear Cardioid Mic** - The improved microphone design features a cardioid pickup pattern that focuses on your voice while suppressing background noise, providing clearer communication than previous-generation Kraken headsets. The retractable design allows the mic to sit flush with the earcup when not in use, improving aesthetics and portability. The flexible gooseneck enables precise positioning for optimal voice pickup.

**Razer Chroma RGB Lighting** - Full Chroma RGB support with access to 16.8 million colors and a suite of lighting effects adds visual personality to the budget headset. The lighting syncs seamlessly with over 300 games and 500 devices across Razer's ecosystem, creating coordinated visual experiences. While RGB on a wired headset might seem unnecessary, it's a nice inclusion that adds value without significantly impacting the price.

**7.1 Surround Sound** - Free 7.1 surround sound software activation provides virtual spatial audio that enhances immersion and positional awareness in games. While not as sophisticated as THX Spatial Audio found in premium models, the 7.1 processing genuinely improves gaming experience by creating a wider soundstage and more distinct directional audio cues. You can upgrade to THX Spatial Audio for more advanced features and game-specific profiles at a discounted rate.

**Hybrid Comfort Cushions** - The ear cushions combine breathable fabric and leatherette in a hybrid design that balances comfort, noise isolation, and thermal management. The fabric sections allow air circulation to prevent heat buildup, while the leatherette provides good acoustic sealing. Combined with memory foam padding, these cushions remain comfortable during marathon gaming sessions.

## Audio Quality

The Kraken V4 X delivers audio performance that punches well above its $79.99 price point. The TriForce drivers produce balanced sound with clear separation between frequency ranges—highs are crisp without harshness, mids are present and detailed, and bass has satisfying impact without overwhelming. For gaming, the soundstage provides good positional awareness in competitive titles, allowing you to track enemy movements and identify audio cues effectively.

The included 7.1 surround sound processing enhances the gaming experience by expanding the soundstage and improving directional audio. While it doesn't match the sophistication of premium spatial audio technologies, it's effective for most gaming scenarios and adds value to the package. Music reproduction is enjoyable with the balanced tuning, offering good clarity across various genres, though audiophiles accustomed to high-end headphones will notice limitations in refinement and detail retrieval. The wired connection eliminates any latency or wireless compression, ensuring pristine audio signal transmission.

## Comfort & Build

At 295g, the Kraken V4 X is lightweight and comfortable for extended gaming sessions. The hybrid fabric-leatherette memory foam cushions strike a good balance between comfort and practicality—they're soft enough to prevent pressure points yet breathable enough to minimize heat buildup. The improved swivel design allows the earcups to rotate for better head conformity, and the adjustable headband operates smoothly with adequate padding.

Build quality is solid for a budget gaming headset, using durable plastic construction throughout. The frame feels robust enough for daily use, though it won't inspire the same confidence as metal-framed premium headsets. The retractable microphone mechanism operates smoothly with a satisfying click when fully extended or retracted. The USB-C cable is detachable (convertible to USB-A via the included adapter), making it easy to replace if damaged and improving long-term value. The onboard volume and mute controls are easily accessible on the earcup. While the all-plastic construction lacks premium feel, it's appropriate for the price point and keeps weight down for better comfort.

## Verdict

The Razer Kraken V4 X represents exceptional value at $79.99, delivering core features from the premium Kraken V4 lineup in an accessible wired package. The TriForce drivers provide audio quality that rivals headsets costing significantly more, while the retractable cardioid microphone ensures clear team communication. The inclusion of Chroma RGB lighting and 7.1 surround sound activation adds nice-to-have features without inflating the price. The hybrid comfort cushions and lightweight design make it genuinely comfortable for all-day gaming, and the convertible USB-C/A cable ensures broad compatibility across platforms.

For budget-conscious gamers, competitive players who prefer wired reliability, or anyone building their first gaming setup, the Kraken V4 X is an easy recommendation. It sacrifices wireless convenience and battery concerns but gains zero latency and cost savings. The only real limitation is platform compatibility—it won't work with Xbox consoles and requires a USB port rather than traditional 3.5mm, which limits use with some controllers. If these constraints don't affect you, the Kraken V4 X offers flagship-quality audio and features at a fraction of the price, making it one of the best value propositions in the budget gaming headset category.
