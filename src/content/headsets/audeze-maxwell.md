## Overview

The Audeze Maxwell is widely considered the best sounding wireless gaming headset on the market. It brings audiophile-grade planar magnetic technology into a feature-rich wireless package.

## Key Features

The 90mm Planar Magnetic drivers deliver speed, detail, and bass extension that dynamic drivers simply can't match. This results in incredibly immersive audio for single-player games and precise imaging for competitive shooters.

Battery life is exceptional at 80 hours. The FILTER™ noise reduction technology uses a dedicated AI processor to remove background noise from your microphone signal, making your voice sound studio-clear.

## Build

It is built like a tank with a steel headband and aluminum yokes. However, this comes at a cost: weight. At 490g, it is significantly heavier than most competitors, which might be a dealbreaker for some.

## Verdict

If audio quality is your number one priority and you don't mind a heavier headset, the Audeze Maxwell is in a league of its own.
