## Overview

Building on the legendary status of the Cloud II, the HyperX Cloud III Wireless focuses on what matters most: comfort, durability, and sound. The headline feature is the massive 120-hour battery life, which means you could game for weeks without charging.

## Key Features

The 53mm angled drivers have been retuned for a more accurate sound profile compared to the bass-heavy predecessor. DTS Headphone:X Spatial Audio is included (on PC) for better immersion.

The 10mm microphone is clearer than previous generations and features an internal mesh pop filter and a built-in LED mute indicator so you know when you're live.

## Comfort

"HyperX Signature Comfort" isn't just a marketing slogan. The memory foam in the headband and ear cushions is plush, and the clamping force is just right. The all-aluminum frame ensures it can take a beating.

## Verdict

If you hate charging your headset and prioritize comfort above flashy features like RGB or simultaneous Bluetooth, the Cloud III Wireless is a reliable workhorse.
