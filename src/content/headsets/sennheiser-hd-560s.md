## Overview

The Sennheiser HD 560S represents the German audio giant's entry-level audiophile offering, delivering reference-grade neutral sound tuned for analytical listening at the accessible price of $199.95. Released in September 2020, these open-back headphones combine elements from several famous Sennheiser models—the reference tuning DNA of the HD 660S with the ultralight comfort chassis of the HD 599—creating something genuinely new for critical listeners who need to understand recordings in complete detail. Unlike gaming headsets with their bass-heavy tuning and flashy features, the HD 560S prioritizes absolute accuracy and transparency, designed specifically for audiophiles evaluating their music's entire journey through the audio path.

The HD 560S makes no concessions to mainstream consumer preferences. There's no wireless operation, no touch controls, no app-based EQ adjustment, no RGB lighting—just a wired, open-back design with 3-meter cable and business-like aesthetics that announce these as professional tools rather than entertainment devices. The packaging literally states "for analytical listening sessions," and Sennheiser means it. For gamers seeking the most accurate positional audio and natural sound reproduction, or for anyone wanting studio-reference sound quality without studio-reference pricing, the HD 560S delivers exceptional value.

## Key Features

The 38mm polymer-blend drivers utilize Sennheiser's E.A.R. (Ergonomic Acoustic Refinement) technology, angling the transducers to recreate the optimal equilateral triangle listening position found in hi-fi speaker setups and professional studios. This angled alignment creates a wide, articulate soundstage without any room treatment, letting you hear neutral versions of recordings unaffected by acoustic artifacts. The drivers feature specialized polymer-blend membranes engineered for linear excursion and improved brilliance above 10kHz, combined with sophisticated damping systems that manage ventilation to deliver deeper bass while mitigating distortion. The 6Hz-38kHz extended frequency response captures deep sub-bass and extended highs beyond typical headphone capabilities.

The 120-ohm impedance makes these relatively easy to drive despite being higher than most gaming headsets—they'll work adequately from phones and portable devices while scaling beautifully with better source equipment like dedicated DACs and amplifiers. At just 240 grams including the extensive cable, the HD 560S achieves ultralight status that creates a "barely there" wearing experience. The open, around-the-ear design with velour earpads keeps ears cool and comfortable during extended sessions, with the ventilated cups never touching the ears themselves. The detachable 3-meter cable terminates in a 6.3mm plug suitable for studio gear, with an included 3.5mm adapter for mobile devices.

## Audio Quality

The HD 560S delivers ruthlessly revealing, neutral sound tuned for absolute accuracy rather than entertainment. The soundstage is genuinely big in all directions with individual elements appearing in solid, well-defined positions. Detail retrieval is sky-high—every nuance of instrument timbre, vocal technique, and recording quality becomes immediately apparent. The frequency response maintains an even, neutral balance from deep bass through extended highs without peaks, dips, or colorations. Bass extends smoothly and deeply (especially impressive between 20-50Hz where nearfield monitors struggle), providing enough low-end for impact without the exaggerated thump gaming headsets offer.

For gaming, the linear acoustics and analytical tuning create exceptional positional accuracy where you can pinpoint enemy locations with confidence in competitive shooters. The wide soundstage enhances immersion in open-world games, while the neutral tuning ensures you hear every audio cue exactly as developers intended. However, the neutral signature won't create the excitement or visceral impact some gamers prefer—explosions sound accurate rather than thrilling, and bass-heavy action sequences lack the rumble closed-back gaming headsets deliver. Music listening reveals these headphones' true purpose: transparent, fatigue-free analytical monitoring that exposes every detail for A/B comparisons, critical evaluation, or pure appreciation of well-recorded material.

## Comfort & Build

At 240 grams, the HD 560S feels almost weightless despite the extensive cable and professional 6.3mm plug included in that figure. The comfort mechanics borrowed from the HD 599 create a "barely there" experience where the headphones disappear during extended sessions. The velour earpads are soft and breathable, keeping all contact points gentle while the open design ensures ears never get warm. The headband provides ample adjustment that stays firmly in position, and the around-ear cups accommodate most ear sizes comfortably. This is comfort engineered for professional use—hours-long mixing sessions, critical listening marathons, or all-day gaming without fatigue.

Build quality reflects functional design over luxury aesthetics. The predominantly plastic construction uses hard, shiny black plastic that feels utilitarian rather than premium, though everything fits together with typical Sennheiser integrity that promises years of reliable service. These look dated and unremarkable—staunchly functional without any style flourishes—but the robust construction suggests they'll survive being tossed in bags or around studios indefinitely. The detachable cable system adds convenience and longevity, allowing easy replacement if the cable gets damaged. Nothing about the HD 560S screams luxury, but nothing feels fragile or cheap either—just professional tools built to last.

## Verdict

The Sennheiser HD 560S excels as reference-grade headphones for listeners who prioritize accuracy and transparency above all else. The neutral tuning, wide soundstage, and exceptional detail retrieval make these outstanding for competitive gaming where positional accuracy matters, for audiophiles wanting honest reproduction of recordings, and for anyone doing critical listening or comparison work. At $200, they represent genuine value for studio-quality sound, delivering performance that competes with headphones costing considerably more. The ultralight comfort supports truly extended sessions, and the open-back design creates natural sound propagation impossible with closed designs.

However, these are specialized tools rather than all-rounders. The neutral signature won't excite casual listeners who prefer bass-heavy, exciting sound, and the analytical presentation can feel clinical rather than engaging. The open-back design makes them unsuitable for noisy environments, commuting, or shared spaces due to complete lack of isolation and significant sound leakage. The functional aesthetics won't appeal to those wanting premium-looking gear, and the lack of any modern conveniences (wireless, controls, software) limits them to pure audio reproduction. For gamers with quiet spaces who want studio-accurate sound, or for anyone needing reference-grade headphones without the reference-grade price, the HD 560S is outstanding. Just know you're buying professional tools rather than entertainment devices.
