## NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### Data Quality
- Not all headsets will have all features - that's OK
- Focus on the most important/common features first
- Mark fields as "Not specified" or null when data is unavailable
- Verify specs against manufacturer websites

### User Experience
- Too many filters overwhelms users - prioritize the top 8-10
- Use progressive disclosure (show "Advanced filters" button)
- Show count of results as filters are applied
- Allow "Clear all filters" option

### Search Strategy
- Users should be able to search by model name, brand
- Consider fuzzy search for typos
- "Quick filters" for common use cases ("Best for PS5", "Under $100", "Wireless only")
