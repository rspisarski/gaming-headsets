## Updates to blog
- we should only be sorting by features. there is no need for price sorting as we will not have updated prices on the headset. we instead should label them as "affordable", "budget", "premium", "ultra premium"
- 

### headsets meta
- We need to build out features and allow them to be apart of something like a tag system so we can filter by them. I would like the features to need to be configured in a way to where we cannot just add a feature that is not already in the system. 
- ie feature tags would look something like this:
    - compatibility: ps5, ps4, pc, switch, mobile
    - cord type: wired, wireless
    - microphone type: boom, retractable, inline, none
    - noise cancellation: true, false, active, pass through, open back
    - rgb lighting: true, false
    - replaceable earpads: true, false
    - software: true, false
    - software app: SteelSeries GG, Razer Synapse, etc 

### homepage
- we should have a section that allows a user to click on a feature and create their own feature list. I think it would be best to have tiers to this feature list. "must have" and "nice to have". this should be a weighted system that sorts the returned headsets for those that fit the criteria best. to make it easy I think we can add tiers to this also. "complete match" "majority match" "partial match" or something along this line. if there is no match then it should not be returned.
